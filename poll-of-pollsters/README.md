### Poll of Pollsters data

This repo contains the responses from 26 pollsters to FiveThirtyEight's [poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15vciUokilOUBF9JDZIQQfuZh-2i_fxkmRVIX3v2xXcc/viewform?usp=send_form) of professional political pollsters, as described in this article:

[Pollsters Predict Greater Polling Error In Midterm Elections](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pollsters-predict-greater-polling-error-in-midterm-elections/)

We sent out the first poll two weeks ago starting Wed. Sept. 24, and 26 responded by the deadline of Monday, Sept. 29, at noon Eastern time. They include commercial and academic pollsters that identify themselves as liberal, nonpartisan or conservative. Some poll online, some by phone, some both.

Some answers have been edited, primarily for spelling, grammar, style and to protect anonymity, when requested.

The responses are broken up into two files:

`poll-of-pollsters.tsv`:

This tab-separated file contains the names of 25 respondents, their polling organizations, and those responses that they have agreed can be attributed to them. (One respondent wished to remain anonymous.) The heading of each column contains a question, and below it, in each row the answer given by the pollster listed in that row. Empty fields either mean the pollster didn't answer that question, or didn't wish to have the answer attributed.

 `poll-of-pollsters-anonymous-answers.tsv`:

This tab-separated file contains those responses that pollsters didn't want attributed to them. The heading of each column contains a question, and below it, the responses to that question, in alphabetical order. That means that each row doesnâ€™t correspond to any one respondent. For example, the answer in the fourth row, in the third column, wasn't necessarily given by the same respondent as the rest of the answers in the fourth row. This sorting step was taken to better protect anonymity, by making it harder to figure out who gave which answer.
